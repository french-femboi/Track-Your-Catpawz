# Track Your Catpawz

Basically with this app/tool you can track my current status, yeah I need to set it manually but in case I'm not answering maybe this could be useful for you, who knows? I'm totally not doing this because I'm slowly loosing my mind, and also totally not because I'm exhausted, and I don't wanna keep going, but I gotta be strong for my future...

Some day I'm probably going to see it and laugh at it, but I will remember how I felt during this time, and honestly I don't want to feel like that ever again, never ever again...

Time i've spent working on this project:
